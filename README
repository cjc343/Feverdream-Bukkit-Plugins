All plugins under thsi directory are AGPL v3.

This means they are a form of GPL with one extra restriction:
If you use them on your server, you must also give out source to them if people ask.

I will enforce this.

There is nothing worse then tryng to learn an API and not having source code to look at to learn.

Don't do that to people, its just cruel.
